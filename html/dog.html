            <p>Dogs: the adorable domestic pet beloved by millions. The dog is one of the most popular pets in the world --
                it is, of course, commonly referred to as 'man’s best friend'. Dogs are also often employed as service animals
                and emotional support animals.</p>
            <p>The best dog in the world for one person could be a nightmare for someone else. When searching for a new dog,
                it is important to avoid breeders that are more interested in making money than producing quality dogs for
                appropriate homes. Breeding dogs for profit is controversial, because there are already many more dogs than
                available homes. </p>
